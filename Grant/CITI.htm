	<li><span>An Introduction to Grants</span>
	<ul>
		<li>What is Grant?
			<ul>
				<li>A grant is money that is awarded to organizations and individuals, normally on a competitive basis, in order for the recipient to carry out a specific project</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>It Starts with a Great Idea
			<ul>
				<li>The central idea should be a solution to the problem</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li>What are you passionate about in your scholarly or professional life?</li>
				<li>What is the problem or need in your area of passion? Why is it important?</li>
				<li>What sources or kinds of data can you use to validate the importance of your proposed project?</li>
				<li>How is/are existing knowledge, practice, or resources inadequate?</li>
				<li>How is your idea new, unique, or better?</li>
				<li>How would the world be a better/different place if you solved the problem or addressed the needs?</li>
			</ol>

			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>Getting Started in Grant Writing</span>
		<ul>
			<li>Timeline
				<ul>
					<li>Idea Development, 1 month</li>
					<li>Funding Search, 1 month</li>
					<li>Proposal Planning, 2-3 months</li>
					<li>Proposal Writing, 2-3 months</li>
					<li>Proposal Submission, 1 week</li>
					<li>Proposal Review, 4-6 months</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>It is different than academic writing
				<ul>
					<li>the ultimate purpose of a grant proposal is to persuade the funding organization to provide resources for a project</li>
					<li>Expository Writing, factual, written in the third person, and free of emotion</li>
					<li>Persuasive Writing, based on facts or evidence, but its purpose is to convince the reader that the writer's idea or point of view is best</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Ask Early, Ask Clearly
				<ul>
					<li>Need a very clear statement about what you are asking for and why</li>
					<li>Has a cover page and the dollar amount of your budget request is on the cover sheet</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>It Is Not About You
				<ul>
					<li>Does it align with the review criteria stated in the guidelines?</li>
					<li>Is it similar to other projects funded by this agency and program?</li>
					<li>Does the program officer respond favorably to your idea?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>More Comparisons of Academic and Grant Writing
				<ul>
					<li>Academic Writing
						<ul>
							<li>Expository</li>
							<li>Idea Focused</li>
							<li>Past Oritented</li>
							<li>Unrestricted Length</li>
							<li>Specialized Vocabulary</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Grant Writing
						<ul>
							<li>Persuasive</li>
							<li>Outcome Focused</li>
							<li>Future Oriented</li>
							<li>Stric Length Constraints</li>
							<li>Accessible Language</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Grant proposals are also typically written in the <span>future tense</span></li>
					<li>Avoid “not” (for example, “we broke no laws” instead of “we did not break any laws”)</li>
					<li>Single Word Replacement
						<ul>
							<li>At this point in time, Now</li>
							<li>Has the potential to, Can or might</li>
							<li>In the near future, Soon</li>
							<li>Owing to the fact that, Because or since</li>
							<li>Makes an attempt, Tries</li>
							<li>In addition to, Also</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The Active Voice: Persuasive and Space-Saving</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Follow the Directions
				<ul>
					<li>80 percent of success is just following the directions</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>You will fail more than you succeed
				<ul>
					<li>The success rate is 18.7 percent for NIH research project grants in 2017</li>
					<li>The overall success rate is 23 percent at NSF in 2015</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Summary
				<ul>
					<li>It takes a long time and significant effort</li>
					<li>It is different than academic writing</li>
					<li>You must follow the rules and directions</li>
					<li>You will fail more than you succeed – and you are in good company</li>
					<li>You will drown if you are just chasing the money</li>

	<li><span>Creating the Proposal Narrative</span>
		<ul>
			<li>Project Description (NSF), Research Strategy (NIH), Project Narrative (Others)
				<ul>
					<li>NSF, the Project Description should outline the <span>general plan</span> of work, including the broad design of activities to be undertaken, and, where appropriate, provide a clear description of <span>experimental methods and procedures</span>. Proposers should address <span>what</span> they want to do, <span>why</span> they want to do it, <span>how</span> they plan to do it, how they will know if they <span>succeed</span>, and what <span>benefits</span> could accrue if the project is successful</li>
					<li>NIH, the narrative should provide an intellectual justification for your project, covering the four areas listed below: <span>research and contribution; methods and work plan; competencies, skills, and access; and final product and dissemination</span>. A simple statement of need or intent is insufficient.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
					<li>Common Proposal Narrative Sections
						<ul>
							<li>Problem Statement, <span>why</span>
								<ul>
									<li>A rationale in the form of a literature review demonstrates your understanding of the problem</li>
									<li>Explain why the problem is of interest to the sponsor</li>
									<li>What has been done (or what is already known) and how your idea is new, different, or better</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Goals and Objectives, <span>what</span> will be done
								<ul>
									<li>What outcomes you will achieve if the project is successful</li>
									<li>Address the project’s significance: why and to whom does it matter?</li>
									<li>The project goals and objectives should be aligned with those of the funding agency or specific program</li>
									<li>Repurpose the RFP’s language in your proposal goals and objectives</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Methodology, <span>how</span> and <span>when</span>
								<ul>
									<li>Describe the <span>activities</span> that will occur during the grant period and provide a <span>timeline</span> of planned activities or experiments</li>
									<li>Must be very specific. The degree of specificity depends on the audience and overall length restrictions on the narrative</li>
									<li>Draft this section by including all of the possible details and then edit it so that the narrative meets the funding opportunity’s length requirements</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Personnel and Project Management, <span>who</span> will be doing the proposed work
								<ul>
									<li>For complex projects involving multiple investigators and/or organizations, include an organizational chart to illustrate the project management plan and team hierarchy</li>
									<li>Provide a brief overview of credentials, roles, and responsibilities for each key project team member</li>
									<li>If space permits, mention the time commitment of each individual or group of individuals, but know that you may have more room for details in the budget justification</li>
									<li>Proposal most likely includes a biographical sketch for each key team member, so it is not necessary to include a great deal of curriculum vitae</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Expected Outcomes
								<ul>
									<li>The project outcomes may be a separate section. Alternatively, the outcomes may be incorporated into the goals and objectives section</li>
									<li>This section may also be called evaluation. It is where you will describe what will happen as a result of your project and how you will measure its success</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Dissemination Plan
								<ul>
									<li>Outline the strategies that will be used to share the results, such as conference presentations, published papers, and/or website or social media postings</li>
									<li>Mention several possible avenues for dissemination also positions you to request funds for these activities in your budget and budget justification</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Grant Guidelines as a Tool for Narrative Organization</li>
					<li>Organizing the NIH Research Proposal Narrative
						<ul>
							<li>Significance</li>
							<li>Innovation</li>
							<li>Approach</li>
							<li>The first two sections answer the <span>why</span> question, the three – addresses issues of <span>what</span>, <span>when</span>, <span>where</span>, and <span>how</span></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Dealing with Specificity
						<ul>
							<li>Know Your Audience</li>
							<li>S.M.A.R.T. Objectives and Aims
								<ul>
									<li>Specific</li>
									<li>Measurable</li>
									<li>Achievable</li>
									<li>Relevant</li>
									<li>Time-bound</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Sentences written with vague verbs like “improve,” “enhance,” and “expand” are appropriate for a goal statement
								<ul>
									<li>Increase the success of students who transfer from Local Community College to Nearby State University</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Objective statements should be S.M.A.R.T.
								<ul>
									<li>Achieve an annual 10 percent increase (above 2018 baseline) in the number of Local Community College associate's degree recipients who earn bachelor's degrees from Nearby State University within three years of matriculation</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
					<li>Methods, Timeline, and Budget
						<ul>
							<li>Methods
								<ul>
									<li>The methods section (or approach in an NIH proposal) requires a substantial amount of detail to satisfy the peer reviewers with expertise in the field</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Timeline
								<ul>
									<li>For longer projects, increments of quarter-years (three months) or semesters (fall, spring, summer) are appropriate for sequencing the project tasks</li>
									<li>Shorter projects, such as one year, might break out the timeline into one- or two-month segments</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Budget
								<ul>
									<li>While technically not a component of the narrative, the budget plays a role in convincing the sponsor that your project is realistic</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

			<li>Making the Most of Review Criteria
				<ul>
					<li>NSF
						<ul>
							<li>holistic review, the proposal is rated in its entirety rather than its individual parts or components</li>
							<li>how your proposed project is new, different, or better than what has been done before, incorporate this in the project summary and allow space throughout the narrative to reinforce the idea</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>NIH
						<ul>
							<li>semi-quantitative review system, assign a preliminary impact score ranging from 1 (exceptional) to 9 (poor) as well as scores from 1 to 9 on 5 review criteria</li>
							<li>The impact score determines whether the proposal is discussed at the review meeting</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>ED
						<ul>
							<li>rubric-driven review, the points assigned to sections and subsections added up for an overall numerical score</li>
							<li>allot more of your time to developing that content and more of the narrative page space to those sections or topics having more points than other sections or topics</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Next Steps After Review
				<ul>
					<li>Classifications of Comments
						<ul>
							<li>The quality of the overall idea (I)</li>
							<li>The fit (F) between the idea and the funding agency's priorities for this program</li>
							<li>The overall organization (O) and presentation of ideas</li>
