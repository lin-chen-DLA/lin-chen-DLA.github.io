					<li>Weight, decrease in weight indicate dehydration</li>
					<li>Morning heart rate, 5 beats per minute higher than usual indicate inadequate reovery or illness</li>
					<li>Environmental conditions, record the temperature and humidity on hot days</li>
					<li>Hours of sleep, indicate needed lifestyle changes to help prevent illness and injury</li>
					<li>Quality of sleep, reduction in quality of sleep is asssociated with overtraining</li>
					<li>Diet quality, a lack of energy can be traced back to poor diet in the previous few days</li>
					<li>Hydration level, daily weight indicates the hydration level</li>
					<li>Muscle soreness, soreness in a specific muscle indicates a potential injury, whereas more-general muscle soreness provides an indication of your recovery and adaptation to training</li>
					<li>Energy level, one of the best indications of recovery from training</li>
					<li>Heart rate at a standard pace, 7 beats per minute higher than usual indicate that you may not be recovered from the previous training sessions</li>
