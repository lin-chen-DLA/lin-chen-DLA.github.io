		</div>

		<div class = "block">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pu Erh was made from Yunnan big leaf seed sun tea.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pu Erh tea is classified into <span>raw tea</span> and <span>ripe tea</span>. Raw tea is made by drying the fresh tea leaf. Ripe tea is made with an extra fermentation step on raw tea by decomposing the proteins in tea with particular bacteria. It is one of the black tea.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the fermentation can last more than tens of years, the aged Pu Erh tea taste even better than the fresh tea. People in China collect Pu Erh ripe tea as an investment. <span>Old tea</span> made before 1950 is worth more than a million RMB per tea cake. The Pu Erh produced in the 1960s can be sold with several hundred thousands of RMB per tea cake. Pu Erh tea market is quite similar to the wine market; recognition of real top Pu Erh tea is not a piece of cake. You need more than ten years to cumulate the knowledge about Pu Erh tea, taste different types of Pu Erh tea from various producers, different places, memorize the packing style of top Pu Erh tea brands. If you bought a low-rank Pu Erh tea cake with a high price, you will have no clue to find out you were fooled until the tea is tasted by some real experts.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 2006,  Pu Erh tea is one type of ordinary tea in China. Its price is the same as other tea, nothing special. Around the summer of 2006, the price of Pu Erh was pushed up by some mysterious investors. In 2007, the price went up at a crazy speed, almost 10% each day. Many people in Yunnan became millionaires wihtin a few months. Simao city, a city that was famous for its Pu Erh, changed its city name to Pu Erh city in 2007. In the summer of 2007, the market changed quickly. Some investors noted that the customers disappeared suddenly. The price of Pu Erh dropped to 10% of its highest price within a few weeks.
