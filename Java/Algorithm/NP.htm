				<li>Optimization problems, each feasible solution has an associated value, and wish to find a feasible solution with the best value. For example, Shortest-Path problem</li>
				<li>Decision problems, answer is simply "Yes" or "No"</li>
				<li>An optimization problem can ben casted to a decision problem by imposing a bound on the value to be optimized. For example, in Shortest-Path problem, find a path from u to v consisting of at most k edges</li>

		<div class = "block">
			<ul>
				<li>P is a complexity class that represents the set of all decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time, O(n<sup>k</sup>)</li>
			</ul>

		<div class = "subtitle">NP</div>
		<div class = "block">
			<ul>
				<li>NP is a complexity class that represents the set of all decision problems for which the instances where the answer is "yes" have proofs that can be verified in polynomial time</li>

		<div class = "subtitle">NP-Complete</div>
		<div class = "block">
			<ul>
				<li>NP-Complete is a complexity class which represents the set of all problems X in NP for which it is possible to reduce any other NP problem Y to X in polynomial time</li>
				<li>So what makes NP-Complete so interesting is that if any one of the NP-Complete problems was to be solved quickly then all NP problems can be solved quickly</li>
