Dear all,

    First all, thanks for your hard work this semester. You guys did great jobs.

    The grading will be completed by the midnight today. Please check your blackboard, let me know ASAP if I missed any of your assignments and projects. I will post your final grade on the banner system at noon tomorrow. After it, we are not able to make any change on it.

    Right now, it is the time to add Scala, Bash Script, make, cmake, prolog, and Azure cloud to your resume.

    Have a nice winter break.

Lin Chen
